PLAYER ABILITIES:
-basic gun
-throw
	either acts on particular object or acts on all objects within a space
	capped force amount, enough to rip objects out of assemblies but not enough to be OP
-specials (powerup abilities, one-time use per powerup)
	grav bomb / magnet (gather objects, perhaps summon?)
	bomb / force blast
	rail driver (selected object(s) is continuously accelerated, if used right large multipart objects could be accelerated to high speeds)
	expanded field / upped force

ENEMY ABILITIES:
-basic shooters
-catchers
	turn to face thrown objects? (would have to coordinate strikes)
	thrown objects cannot be directly controlled?
-rockets
	charge time/slow proj

ROBOT MOVEMENT IDEAS:
-stop-n-shoot
-orbit
-approach from front or back?

GAMEPLAY:
-physics damage is effective in combat, but shotgun is effective at close range
-If objects are sparse onscreen, more objects appear from ahead (increases probabilities)
-CANNOT THROW ROBOTS DIRECTLY, just gets ridiculous when you can do that
-could also make it a strategy to push robots offscreen (maybe if you do that too much it triggers a large spawn event? or not, too intensive)
